    <h1>Nick B. Allen</h1>
    <p>Nick is a widely acclaimed author of rudimentary autobiographical websites. His most recent work, "Github Page for Nick Allen," is available at <a href="nickballen.github.io">nickballen.github.io</a><br/><br/> 
    Nick's first project will involve mapping the distribution of tetanus vaccination clinics in the United States, because his familiarity with geospatial tech is dangerously rusty.<br/><br/>
   
    One of Nick's favorite visualizations is this <a href="http://code.waag.org/buildings">age-shaded map of Amersterdam's buildings.</a> Nick is  interested in representing built environments and their historical succession with time sliders and whatnot, which would require a database of vector objects tagged with construction and demolition dates. His efforts to do so are stunted by his weak abilities in image-based feature extraction and time-based visualization, as well as an acute lack of funding and time. Nick thinks this would be a pretty versatile way to examine contested processes of urban development and histories of disposession and urban expansion.</p>
